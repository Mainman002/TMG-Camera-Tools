## My Goals for this add-on:
* Keep the layout as simple / unified as possible without adding too much bloat (Might have stretched this goal a little xD)
* Organize features to their respective panels as much as I possibly can
* Try my best to use built in operators / properties without adding too many custom operators / properties
